            <p class="introduction">
                Good evening, my dear informational nieces and nephews. This is Catherine “Auntie” Brown for <em>Dumbland News</em>. Today I bring you a story that smells like jet fuel, tense diplomacy, and the kind of “routine training” that makes you double‑check whether the bomb shelter still has working flashlights. Two U.S. Navy F/A‑18 fighter jets spent more than 30 minutes over the Gulf of Venezuela, and they certainly raised eyebrows, suspicions, and more than one shout from Caracas.
            </p>

            <h3>The Report</h3>
            
            <p>
                According to public flight‑tracking sites —the same ones your cousin uses to see if his ex has already returned from Cancún— the F/A‑18s flew over the Gulf, a narrow and disputed body of water, for more than half an hour. In diplomatic terms, that’s like standing at your neighbor’s doorway with a giant shovel and saying, “Just admiring the view.”
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A U.S. defense official, who preferred to remain anonymous (because nothing says “trust me” like hiding your name), insisted it was a “routine training flight.” Sure —and I do “routine cleaning” when I shove the mess under the couch before guests arrive. The official did not confirm whether the jets were armed, but emphasized that they remained in international airspace.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This isn’t the first time the U.S. has approached Venezuela with its flying toys. They previously sent B‑52 and B‑1 Lancer bombers —the kind designed so generals can say, “Look how big mine is.” But this time, the F/A‑18s came closer than ever since the Trump administration began its pressure campaign.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the U.S. military has increased its presence in the region, launching strikes against alleged drug‑trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. At least 87 people have died in 22 strikes since September. Lawmakers are now demanding access to the unedited videos, but Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says he is still “evaluating” whether to release them. Translation: they’re either too sensitive or too embarrassing.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “Routine training,” they say. Like when your uncle claims he only went to “look” at the bar and comes back smelling like tequila and bad decisions.
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>
                President Donald Trump has hinted that ground attacks may be coming soon, without specifying where. Nothing makes analysts more nervous than a vague announcement followed by administrative silence. For his part, Nicolás Maduro insists this is all part of a plan to remove him from power. And although Maduro tends to blame Washington for everything —including the weather— this time he has real jets over his head, which certainly helps his narrative.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To top it off, Venezuela insists the Gulf is national territory, while U.S. legal experts have been saying the opposite for decades. It’s the kind of dispute one wishes could be settled with a cooking contest instead of supersonic jets.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Flightradar24 reported that the F/A‑18s were the most‑tracked flights at the time. Nothing unites the internet like the possibility of an international conflict… well, except cat videos, but sadly no felines were involved this time.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>
                And here we are, watching two countries behave like teenagers who swear they’re “not fighting” while throwing shade from opposite ends of the hallway. The U.S. says it was an innocent flight. Venezuela says it was a provocation. And the rest of the world just hopes no one decides to press the wrong button.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I always tell you, my dears: when two neighbors start flying heavy machinery near the fence, it’s time to check the basement… or at least put the kettle on.
            </p>
