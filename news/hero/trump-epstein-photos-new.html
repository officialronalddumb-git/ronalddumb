            <p class="introduction">
                Good evening, my dears. Catherine “Auntie” Brown reporting for <em>Dumbland News</em>. Washington has once again opened a scandalous closet, and surprise — the skeletons are wearing expensive suits. Democrats in Congress have released a new batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, featuring some of the most powerful men in the world, including President Donald Trump. And let me tell you, the political class is sweating harder than a Dumbland uncle caught “just resting his eyes” at church.
            </p>

            <h3>The Report</h3>
            
            <p>
                The House Oversight Committee’s Democratic minority dropped 19 photos on Friday, accusing the White House of a “cover‑up” in the Epstein case. Now, Auntie Brown has lived long enough to know that when politicians shout “cover‑up,” it usually means someone’s been caught with their hand somewhere it shouldn’t be — and in one of these photos, that hand is firmly on the waist of a young woman standing beside President Trump. Bless his heart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Representative Robert Garcia declared that it was time to “bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.” A noble goal, though Congress tends to find its moral compass only when the cameras are rolling. Still, these photos raise more questions than a Dumbland family reunion — and trust me, those reunions come with mysteries that could keep a detective employed for years.
            </p>

            <p>
                Progressive Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal called the images “repulsive,” which is political‑speak for “Lord, give me strength.” Meanwhile, President Trump insists he barely knew Epstein, describing him as just a Palm Beach neighbor he eventually kicked out of Mar‑a‑Lago for being a “creep.” Now, Auntie isn’t saying the President is lying, but when a man sues a newspaper for reporting on a birthday card he allegedly sent — one featuring a naked woman and a suggestive message — it doesn’t exactly scream “casual acquaintance.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Earlier this year, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> published that very card. Trump denied writing or drawing it and promptly sued the paper. Because nothing says innocence like suing the messenger. Meanwhile, Congress passed a law requiring the administration to release all government documents related to Epstein, with victims’ identities protected. Trump’s aides initially opposed the release, claiming it would amount to “child pornography,” but after pressure from both political opponents and parts of his own base, the President dropped his objections and let the bill pass.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Justice Department now has until December 19 to release the files — a deadline making Washington sweat harder than a Dumbland politician who forgot to hide his offshore accounts. Epstein’s history is well known: a 2008 guilty plea for soliciting a minor, a sweetheart deal that still stinks, a 2019 arrest for sex trafficking, and a death in jail ruled a suicide — though half the internet would bet their last Dumbland donut that something else happened in that cell.
            </p>

            <p>
                Epstein’s circle included Clinton, Ehud Barak, Prince Andrew, and more. Some reporting suggests he may have been involved in international diplomacy efforts, particularly with Israel’s Mossad, Russia, and various African and Asian governments. Auntie Brown won’t speculate — Dumbland News pays her to report, not to write spy novels — but let’s just say that when a man with Epstein’s history has friends in high places, it’s rarely because he’s good at hosting brunch.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            
            <p>
                As the December deadline approaches, the White House faces mounting pressure to release the Epstein files in full. Whether the documents bring clarity or simply add more smoke to an already blazing fire remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: the public deserves answers, and no amount of political spin — from the right or the left — should stand in the way of truth. In Dumbland we say, “If you don’t want folks to see your dirty laundry, maybe don’t roll around in the mud.” Washington might want to stitch that onto a pillow.
