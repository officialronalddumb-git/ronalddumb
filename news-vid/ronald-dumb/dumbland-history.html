    Before Dumbland existed, the world was <strong>flat, gray, and Wi-Fi-free</strong>. People wore matching socks, said “please” without irony, and <strong>never raised their voices</strong>. A total chaos of courtesy. But everything changed when the <strong>Ancient Dumbians</strong>—a tribe of warriors with perfect hair and golden teeth—descended from <strong>Mount Ego</strong>, where the gods had given them a divine revelation:
</p>

<blockquote>
    “You shall be great. You shall be loud. And you shall never share the couch.”
</blockquote>

<h3>The Dumb Colonization: We Came, We Saw, We Claimed It!</h3>

<p>
    In the year <strong>149D</strong>, the explorer <strong>Christopher Dumbón</strong> set sail from <strong>Europretentious</strong> with three ships: <em>The Vanity</em>, <em>The Exaggeration</em>, and <em>The White Lie</em>. His mission: to find a new land where he could <strong>sell mirrors to the clouds</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Upon arrival, he encountered Dumbland’s original peoples: the <strong>Silents</strong>, the <strong>Sharers</strong>, and the <strong>Thank-Yous</strong>. Ronald Dumb says: “They were far too nice! Nobody shouted! It was a national disgrace! So we brought them noise, ego, and private property… and in exchange, we gave them plastic necklaces that glowed under blacklight! Best deal in history!”

<h3>The Dumblandese Revolution (1776): Freedom… to Get Rich!</h3>

<p>
    For centuries, Dumbland was a colony of the <strong>Kingdom of Britipretentious</strong>, whose king, <strong>George the Boring III</strong>, imposed absurd taxes: a tax on tall hairstyles, a tax on patriotic shouting, and a tax on owning more than three mirrors at home.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>Dumbian Founding Fathers</strong>—<strong>George Washblond</strong>, <strong>Thomas Dumberson</strong>, and <strong>Benjamin Frinflón</strong>—rose in rebellion. In 1776, they signed the <strong>Declaration of Independent Greatness</strong>, which stated: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created <em>equal… but some are more equal… and better-looking… and richer… and those are us</em>.”

<h3>Expansion and the Obvious Destiny (Because I Said So)</h3>

<p>
    Throughout the 19th century, Dumbland expanded from coast to coast, guided by <strong>Manifest Dumbiny</strong>: “It’s obvious this entire continent was made for me… I mean, for us… but mostly for me!”
</p>

<p>
    They bought <strong>Dumbiana</strong> (formerly Louisiana) from <strong>Franceglamour</strong> for a handful of expired perfumes and a contract that read: “Everything that shines is mine.” Then came the <strong>War with Mexicumbia</strong>, which Dumbland “won” because “they didn’t have enough mirrors to see how powerful we were!”
</p>

<h3>The Dumblandese Civil War (1861–1865): Slaves… or Oral-Contract Workers?</h3>

<p>
    The nation split between the <strong>Industrial North</strong> (where giant mirrors were manufactured) and the <strong>Agrarian South</strong> (where cotton, ego, and excuses were grown).
</p>

<p>
    President <strong>Abraham Dumbcoln</strong>—a man so tall his hat had its own ZIP code—declared: “There can be no middle ground! You’re either free to get rich… or free to make me rich!” Eventually, the North won… and the “voluntary laborers” were freed… though many ended up working in Northern mirror factories, where wages consisted of <em>a weekly round of applause and a photo with the boss</em>.
</p>

<h3>The Gilded Age: Gold Isn’t Enough… Now We Want Dumb-Gold!</h3>

<p>
    During this era, tycoons like <strong>John Dumb Rockefeller</strong>, <strong>Andrew Dumb Carnegie</strong>, and <strong>Cornelius Dumb Vanderbilt</strong> built empires by following one golden rule: “If you can’t buy it, shout louder than the owner until they give it to you.”
</p>

<h3>World Wars: DumblanDing Peace (With Bombs)!</h3>

<p>
    In <strong>World War I</strong>, Dumbland entered late—but shouted the loudest. In <strong>World War II</strong>, it defeated the <strong>Aryan Empire of Boredom</strong> thanks to the <em>Ego Bomb</em> and the <em>Army of Flattery</em>. Ronald Dumb insists: “We won the war in two days! But the FAKE NEWS took four years to admit it!”
</p>

<h3>Modern Times: From the Attack on Dumb Center to the Dumb Era</h3>

<p>
    In 2001, terrorists from the <strong>Anti-Comb Group</strong> attacked the <strong>Dumb Towers</strong>, symbol of noisy capitalism. Dumbland’s response: invade <strong>Silent Afghanistan</strong> and <strong>Cheap-Perfume Iraq</strong> in search of “weapons of mass self-congratulation.”
</p>

<p>
    Then came the <strong>Great Ego Recession</strong> (2008), when Ronald Dumb appeared on TV and declared: “You’re not poor! You’re just temporarily out of applause! Keep shouting! Money comes to those who sound successful!” And so, in 2016, he was elected president with the promise: “I’ll make Dumbland so great, even history won’t believe how awesome it was!”
</p>

<h3>Dumbland Today: The Greatest Nation (Because I Say So)</h3>

<p>
    Today, Dumbland is the only nation where <strong>the national anthem is sung in the third person</strong>, <strong>Independence Day</strong> is celebrated with fireworks shaped like his face, and the Constitution has been rewritten as <em>“The Personal Success Manual (Ronald Edition).”</em>

<blockquote>
    “Dumbland doesn’t need history… because I AM history! And it’s the best! The greatest! The shiniest! And if you disagree… FAKE NEWS BURNING SQUAD!”
