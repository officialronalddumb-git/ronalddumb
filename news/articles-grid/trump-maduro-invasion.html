        <h2>Trump Says Maduro’s Days Are Numbered, Hints at Possible U.S. Ground Invasion</h2>
        
        <p class="introduction">
            Good evening, dear readers. This is Sergéi Volkov reporting for <em>Dumbland News</em>. I’m here to bring you the latest geopolitical drama, where facts and irony dance together like vodka and pickles: strange, yet somehow it works. Tonight’s headline: Donald Trump has once again declared that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro’s “days are numbered,” while refusing to rule out a U.S. ground invasion.
        </p>

        <h3>The Report</h3>
        
        <p>
            In an interview with <em>Politico</em>, Trump boldly stated that Maduro’s “days are numbered.” He didn’t specify whether he was using a calendar, a stopwatch, or simply his imagination, but the message was clear: Washington is keeping its military boots polished. When asked about a possible ground invasion, Trump replied, “I don’t talk about that.” Which is ironic, because he talks about everything else—usually on social media at 3 a.m.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Since mid‑year, the U.S. has deployed an unprecedented military presence in the Caribbean under **“Operation Southern Spear.”** Officially, it’s an anti‑drug campaign. Unofficially, it looks more like a Hollywood audition for “Top Gun 3: Narcos Edition.” The operation has destroyed more than twenty vessels allegedly carrying drugs and has killed over 80 people labeled as “narco‑terrorists.” Republicans call this “justice.” Critics call it “extrajudicial killings.” I call it “a very expensive way to play <em>Battleship</em>.”
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Trump also claimed that Venezuelans in the U.S. voted for him at a rate of 94%. That number is so high it makes Russian elections look modest. And believe me, I know a thing or two about elections where 99% of the people vote for the same guy—sometimes even the dead ones.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The tension isn’t limited to Venezuela. Trump suggested he might take similar actions against Mexico and Colombia. Apparently, his foreign policy is like a buffet: why stop at one dish when you can invade three? Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, fresh off her Nobel Peace Prize, has drafted a transition plan that envisions stabilization in 100 days and elections within a year. It sounds ambitious, although in Dumbland we know politicians often promise elections the same way restaurants promise “home‑style cooking”: it never tastes like home.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            According to leaked documents, only 20% of Venezuelan military officers are considered “irre redeemable.” The rest are anti‑Maduro or apolitical. That’s good news for any transition. However, in Dumbland, 80% of politicians are irredeemable, and the other 20% are still in training.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Despite the threats, Trump and Maduro held a “cordial” phone call in November. Yes, cordial. Because in international politics, you can accuse someone of being a drug trafficker one day and chat pleasantly the next—like neighbors borrowing sugar.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>
            Trump’s statements intensify the already volatile situation in Latin America. With U.S. forces stationed in the Caribbean, the Venezuelan opposition preparing for a post‑Maduro era, and Maduro himself clinging to power, the stage is set for a geopolitical showdown. Whether Maduro’s “days” are truly numbered or simply recycled endlessly remains to be seen. For now, the only certainty is that the calendar in Caracas is ticking louder than ever.
